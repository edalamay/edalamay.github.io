# Commit - A Wow Raiding Guild Website

Wanted to play with some new JS ideas and concepts, and figured making a website for a WoW raiding guild I'm a part of was a fun place to start.
Created some simple branding, and then set up this site. Site includes API's from Twitch & Raider.io.

## Installation

Open the directory in terminal and run:

```bash
npm i
```

## Build Process
Current setup utilizes [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Laravel-Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/), with [Browser-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync) for local development.
To spin up a dev env, just run:
```bash
npm run watch
```
And to run a prod build, you can run:
```bash
npm run prod
```
